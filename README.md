# CSS-Robot
With this project, I have learnt : <br>
1. Making simple shapes with HTML and CSS.<br>
2. Sneaky ways to use border properties.<br>
3. New tricks with gradients and background-size.<br>
4. CSS positioning in depth.<br>
5. The idea of "in front of" and "behind" in CSS.<br>
6. Writing CSS transforms to flip and rotate elements.<br>
7. Advanced buttons with Javascript.<br>
8. Updating style with JQuery.<br>
This is a simple css-robot. I made this project with the help of online tutorials. Special credits to StackOverflow, GeneralAssembly for this.
