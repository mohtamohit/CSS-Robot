# CSS-Robot

With this project, I have learnt : 
1. Making simple shapes with HTML and CSS.
2. Sneaky ways to use border properties.
3. New tricks with gradients and background-size.
4. CSS positioning in depth.
5. The idea of "in front of" and "behind" in CSS.
6. Writing CSS transforms to flip and rotate elements.
7. Advanced buttons with Javascript.
8. Updating style with JQuery.

This is a simple css-robot. I made this project with the help of online tutorials. Special credits to StackOverflow, GeneralAssembly for this.
